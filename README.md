Q1. Implement Adaboost on Decision Stump (they should  use Decision Tree learnt in assignment #1) and solve it for the case of real input and discrete output (like iris data set)

Q2. Implement LinearRegression(fit_intercept: True, method='normal') to implement linear regression with option of fit_intercept and method as normal equation.

Q3. Implement Bagging(BaseModel, num_estimators): where base model could be LinearRegression or DecisionTree they have implemented.

Q4. Implement RandomForest(DecisionTree, num_estimators)
